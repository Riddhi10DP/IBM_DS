        "# Building a Generative AI Application with LlamaIndex and SingleStore\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to this comprehensive guide on building a state-of-the-art Generative AI application using LlamaIndex and SingleStoreDB. This guide aims to provide a seamless experience, offering step-by-step instructions, code explanations, and best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "Vertex AI, a product by Google Cloud, offers an integrated suite of machine learning tools that allows developers to build, deploy, and scale AI models faster than ever. On the other hand, SingleStoreDB offers a fast, scalable, and SQL-compliant relational database system. By combining the power of Vertex AI's machine learning capabilities with the efficient storage and retrieval mechanisms of SingleStoreDB, we can create robust AI applications that respond to user queries in real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What You'll Learn\n",
        "- Setting up your environment with the necessary packages and credentials.\n",
        "- Fetching and processing data to be used in our AI models.\n",
        "- Storing and managing data efficiently using SingleStoreDB.\n",
        "- Leveraging the power of Vertex AI for real-time data processing and insights.\n",
        "- Building a retrieval-based QA system to answer user queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Prerequisites\n",
        "- Basic knowledge of Python programming.\n",
        "- Familiarity with Google Cloud services and SQL databases.\n",
        "- An active Google Cloud account.\n",
        "- A SingleStoreDB hosted or self-managed instance.\n",
